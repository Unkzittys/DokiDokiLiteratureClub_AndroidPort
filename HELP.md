# Game Help

This file exists to help the user of this software about extra features that are not mentioned within it through graphical representations or other means. It is highly recommended that you read it in its entirety before starting to use it.

## Game Directory Working

The files the game works with are divided into two types: 'Emulated Storage' and 'Simulated Storage'. Their basic definition is as follows:

- The 'Emulated Storage' consists of files that can be accessed and modified by the player without any type of decompilation.
- The 'Simulated Storage' consists of files that are present in the game through a compilation, and cannot be accessed or modified by the player keeping the exact same information.

Note: This software will never be able to access or modify files present on your device that are not on its directory other than those necessary for its operation.

## User Access to Files

The game files are present in the following path: `'/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/com.unkzittys.dokidokiliteratureclub/files'`. However, access to files in the 'Android/data' folders has been restricted in standard Android file manager apps starting with Android OS version 11. To be able to see the game files, follow this quick tutorial:

1. Download a special file manager. [Recommended app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.alphainventor.filemanager)

2. Once installed navigate to the game directory until this popup appears:

3. You should be taken to the Android directory selector. Once you're sure you're in the game folder, press the 'Use This Folder' button.
